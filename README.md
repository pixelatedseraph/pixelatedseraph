### greetings, stranger.  
it seems you’ve wandered into my digital notebook —  
a collection of ideas, thoughts, and messy code that somehow *works*.  
where logic meets hardware, and late-night curiosities turn into cli tools.  

sit a while, read a line or two,  
and perhaps you’ll glimpse the strange poetry  
that hides within circuits and syntax.  

i’m mazeed — though i often go by the pseudonym **ace**.

### 🕯️ philosophy & beliefs  

i strive to build programs that are free — not just in cost, but in spirit.  
though i hold no hatred for proprietary software, i find solace in foss —  
in the open exchange of ideas, and the quiet rebellion of shared code.  

to me, programming is not a job nor a ritual of syntax;  
it is a craft — a bridge between machine and mind.  
each line a brushstroke, each loop a heartbeat.  

in the end, programming is my love letter to the machine —  
a dialogue between silicon and my soul.

### ⚙️ what i build  

i build for the sake of satisfying my soul — and for the thrill of understanding.  
most of my creations live close to the metal: written in c, c++, or assembly.  
c is my native tongue — my chef’s knife, my instrument of choice.  
with it, i build what i dream of.

### 🌙 closing thoughts  

in the end, i build not for fame nor fortune — but for the joy of creation.  
each project, a quiet dialogue with the machine;  
each bug, a lesson written in binary.  

to me, code is a form of art —  
and every system, no matter how small,  
deserves to be understood, shaped, and loved.  

so if you’ve read this far, stranger — thank you.  
perhaps, somewhere in this digital haze,  
you too may join me in this journey :D
