### greetings, stranger.  
it seems you’ve wandered into my digital notebook —  
a collection of ideas, thoughts, and messy code that somehow *works*.  
where logic meets hardware, and late-night curiosities turn into cli tools.  

sit a while, read a line or two,  
and perhaps you’ll glimpse the strange poetry  
that hides within circuits and syntax.  

i’m mazeed — though most know me as **ace**.
