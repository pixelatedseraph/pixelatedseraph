### greetings, stranger.  
it seems like you’ve wandered into my digital notebook —  
a collection of ideas, thoughts, and messy code that somehow *works*.  
where logic meets hardware, and late-night curiosities turn into cli tools.  

sit a while, read a line or two,  
and perhaps you’ll glimpse the strange poetry  
that hides within circuits and syntax.  

i’m mazeed — though i often go by the pseudonym **ace**.

### philosophy & beliefs  

i strive to build programs that are free — not just in cost, but in spirit.  
though i hold no hatred for proprietary software, i find solace in foss —  
in the open exchange of ideas, and the quiet rebellion of shared code.  

to me, programming is not a job nor a ritual of syntax;  
it is a craft — a bridge between machine and mind.  
each line a brushstroke, each loop a heartbeat.  

as much as i cherish the gnu philosophy, i remain pragmatic —  
freedom means choice, not dogma.  
i see code as art, logic as rhythm, and systems as living canvases.  

in the end, programming is my love letter to the machine —  
a dialogue between silicon and my soul.
